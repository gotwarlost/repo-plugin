<div>
  This "parameter" passes the repo revision and the expanded manifest built by
  this project into the specified job, and thereby causes the specified job to
  check out the exact same source tree for all repositories. This is useful to chain
  multiple activities in a sequence that acts on the same commit in different ways.
